##### What is a Flow?

Flows are used to export data out of one application and import it into another application. A Flow is basically an [Export](#Export) linked to one or more [Imports](#Import). A Flow can channel data generated by a real time export, or if real-time is not an options (based on the application where data is being exported) a Flow can be scheduled to run on a periodic basis. Flows can be scheduled to run as often as once per minute; however, only one instance of a Flow can run at any given time (i.e. you cannot run the same Flow more than once at the same time, and if a Flow is still running when it is scheduled to run again it will simply queue itself up and run when the currently running instance completes).
